# Fantasy Theme

This is the Fantasy Theme for AMP by both Iceofwraith (James Manker) and by ssfdre38 (Daniel Elliott).

To have this theme be used fully, you will need to add the Fantasy.css file to the Themes folder in `ADS01/WebRoot/Themes` and then go to `Configuration > System Settings` and then go to the tab `System` and then change it in the box called `AMP Themes` to Fantasy.

You will need to do a hard refresh for the theme to take affect on your AMP on your current browser.

For Community Pages to match up with your Panel, The theme will take over the default css for Community Pages. It's a cut down version of the theme with a hard set instance preview image.

# Side Notes #
There are 3 Fantasy Files on here and each one is different in their own ways. The ones that I'm working on is the `Fantasy.css` and `Fantasy-bgurl.css` as that is ment for the public use and the `Fantasy-Gladys.css` is a custom version for a member of the Discord Community.

`Fantasy.css` has the background base64 encoded into the css file so its all in one. `Fantasy-bgurl.css` does not have the background base64 encoded and is linked to the `fantasy.jpg` image file. That is more ment for someone who wants to change the background to an image of their own choosing.
